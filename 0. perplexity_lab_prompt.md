Create a python program that integrates METAR airport weather conditions with Anduril Lattice SDK using SDK resources and code examples from https://docs.anduril.com, https://github.com/anduril/lattice-sdk-python, https://github.com/anduril/sample-app-ais-integration-grpc. Find a free API to retrieve a list of all METAR station airports in New England. Using the list of airports find a free API to retrieve current METAR and TAF reports.  Build an integration with Lattice and post Lattice entities representing the airport name, ICAO, METAR report in raw and decoded forms, and METAR condition VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR
