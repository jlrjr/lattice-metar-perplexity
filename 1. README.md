# METAR to Lattice Weather Integration

A Python application that integrates METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) airport weather conditions with the Anduril Lattice SDK. This integration retrieves real-time weather data for New England airports and publishes Lattice entities representing airports with their current weather conditions and flight categories (VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR).

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Retrieves current METAR and TAF reports from the FAA Aviation Weather Center
- **Flight Condition Classification**: Automatically determines VFR, MVFR, IFR, or LIFR conditions based on visibility and ceiling
- **Comprehensive Airport Coverage**: Includes 19+ major New England airports across all 6 states
- **Lattice Integration**: Publishes weather data as Lattice entities with proper geolocation and metadata
- **Automatic Updates**: Continuously monitors weather conditions with configurable update intervals
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with logging and automatic retry logic

## Flight Condition Classifications

The system automatically determines flight conditions based on FAA standards:

- **VFR (Visual Flight Rules)**: Ceiling > 3,000' AGL and visibility > 5 miles
- **MVFR (Marginal VFR)**: Ceiling 1,000-3,000' AGL and/or visibility 3-5 miles
- **IFR (Instrument Flight Rules)**: Ceiling 500-999' AGL and/or visibility 1-3 miles
- **LIFR (Low IFR)**: Ceiling < 500' AGL and/or visibility < 1 mile

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Access to an Anduril Lattice environment
- Valid Lattice API credentials (Environment Token)
- Internet connection for accessing FAA weather data

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the integration files**

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Or install manually**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LATTICE_URL="your-lattice-instance.com"
export ENVIRONMENT_TOKEN="your-bearer-token"
export SANDBOXES_TOKEN="your-sandbox-token"  # Optional, for Lattice Sandboxes
```

### Alternative Configuration

You can also copy `config_template.yml` to `config.yml` and edit it with your settings.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the integration
python metar_lattice_integration.py
```

### Advanced Usage

The integration will:
1. Connect to the FAA Aviation Weather Center API
2. Retrieve current METAR and TAF data for all New England airports
3. Parse weather data and determine flight conditions
4. Create Lattice entities for each airport with weather information
5. Publish entities to your Lattice environment
6. Repeat every 30 minutes (configurable)

## Data Sources

- **METAR Data**: FAA Aviation Weather Center (aviationweather.gov)
- **TAF Data**: FAA Aviation Weather Center (aviationweather.gov)
- **Airport Information**: Compiled from official FAA records

## Lattice Entity Structure

Each airport weather entity includes:

- **Entity Type**: Sensor Point of Interest (weather station)
- **Location**: Precise airport coordinates
- **Metadata**: Airport name, ICAO code, city, state
- **Weather Data**: 
  - Flight conditions (VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR)
  - Temperature and dewpoint
  - Wind direction and speed
  - Visibility and ceiling
  - Raw METAR report
  - TAF forecast (when available)

## Error Handling

The integration includes robust error handling:

- **Network failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **API rate limiting**: Respects FAA API guidelines
- **Parsing errors**: Graceful handling of malformed weather data
- **Lattice connectivity**: Automatic reconnection attempts

## Logging

All activities are logged with configurable levels:
- **INFO**: Normal operations and successful publishes
- **WARNING**: Missing data or minor issues
- **ERROR**: Failed API calls or publish attempts
- **DEBUG**: Detailed troubleshooting information

## Customization

### Adding Additional Airports

To add more airports, edit the `NewEnglandAirports.AIRPORTS` dictionary in the main file:

```python
"KXXX": {
    "name": "Airport Name",
    "city": "City",
    "state": "ST",
    "lat": 00.0000,
    "lon": -00.0000
}
```

### Modifying Update Frequency

Change the `update_interval_minutes` parameter in the `run_integration()` call:

```python
await integration.run_integration(update_interval_minutes=15)  # Update every 15 minutes
```

### Filtering Airports

Modify the integration to include only specific airports:

```python
# Only include major airports
major_airports = ['KBOS', 'KMHT', 'KBDL', 'KPVD', 'KBTV', 'KBGR', 'KPWM']
icao_codes = [code for code in icao_codes if code in major_airports]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"LATTICE_URL and ENVIRONMENT_TOKEN environment variables must be set"**
   - Ensure environment variables are properly exported
   - Check that tokens are valid and not expired

2. **"Failed to retrieve METAR data"**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify FAA weather API is accessible
   - Check for API rate limiting

3. **"Failed to publish weather entity"**
   - Verify Lattice URL and credentials
   - Check network connectivity to Lattice
   - Ensure proper SSL/TLS configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export PYTHONLOG=DEBUG
```

## API Rate Limits

The integration respects FAA Aviation Weather Center API guidelines:
- Maximum 1 request per second
- Batch requests for multiple airports
- Uses appropriate User-Agent headers

## Security Considerations

- Store Lattice credentials securely
- Use environment variables or secure configuration files
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor for unauthorized access
